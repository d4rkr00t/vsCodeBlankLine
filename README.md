# A Blank line at the end of the file!
## Don't you hate it when git complains there's no blank line at the end of a file? Me too!!

Whenever you save a file this extension will automatically add the blank line if needed, not otherwise. A message box will alert you, you can dismiss it with the "Close" button or just hit Esc.

If you didn't want the line, you can hit "Revert!" and it will remove it for you and re-save the file un-blank-lined!

If this is bugging you because this one file should have a line at the end, just hit "Stop that!". It will stop that. From happening
